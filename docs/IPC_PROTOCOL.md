# IPC Protocol Reference

kcd exposes a Unix socket for inter-process communication. This document is the
authoritative reference for client authors who want to build tools against the
daemon without importing Go packages.

---

## 1. Transport

- **Socket path:** `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kcd/kcd.sock` (typically
  `/run/user/<uid>/kcd/kcd.sock`)
- **Type:** Unix stream socket (`SOCK_STREAM`)
- **Framing:** Newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON). Every message is a single JSON
  object terminated by `\n`. The daemon reads one line per request from its
  `bufio.Scanner`.
- **Max request payload:** No explicit limit (scanner reads a single line; Unix
  socket buffer is the practical bound). Do not send payloads exceeding ~1 MiB
  over IPC; use the side-channel TLS port for file transfers instead.

---

## 2. Request / Response Format

### Request

```json
{"cmd": "<command>", "payload": <optional JSON value>}
```

- `cmd` (`string`, required) — the command name.
- `payload` (`JSON`, optional) — per-command parameters. Parsed as
  `json.RawMessage` by the handler. If absent, the field must be omitted or
  `null`.

### Response (non-watch commands)

```json
{"ok": true, "data": <optional JSON>}
{"ok": false, "error": "human-readable message"}
```

- `ok` (`bool`) — success.
- `error` (`string`, present only when `ok` is `false`) — error description.
- `data` (`JSON`, present only when `ok` is `true` and the command has a
  payload) — response payload. Refer to the per-command reference for its shape.

### Error responses

All errors return the same shape. The `error` string is human-readable and may
change between releases. Do not parse it programmatically beyond logging.

```json
{"ok": false, "error": "device not found"}
```

---

## 3. Command Reference

Every command, its request payload, and its response data shape.

### 3.1 Built-in Commands (handler.go)

#### `devices`

List all known devices (paired + unpaired).

**Request payload:** none

**Response data:** `[]DeviceInfo`

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_...",
      "name": "Pixel 9",
      "type": "phone",
      "state": "PAIRED",
      "cert_fp": "",
      "last_seen": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "connected": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Permanent device identifier |
| `name` | string | Human-readable device name |
| `type` | string | `"phone"`, `"tablet"`, `"laptop"`, `"desktop"` |
| `state` | string | `"UNPAIRED"`, `"PAIR_REQUESTED"`, `"PAIR_REQUESTED_BY_PEER"`, `"PAIRED"` (`"UNKNOWN"` may appear in state files written by older versions and means unpaired) |
| `cert_fp` | string | Not populated in this response (empty) |
| `last_seen` | string (RFC3339) | Last time the device was seen (announcement or connection) |
| `connected` | bool | Whether the device currently has an active TCP connection. Note: `connected: true` alone does **not** mean usable — a stranger on the LAN can hold a raw connection while `state` is `UNPAIRED`. Clients must check `state == "PAIRED"` before sending commands or auto-selecting a device. |
| `battery` | object (optional) | `{"charge": 85, "charging": true}` — cached battery state |
| `media` | object (optional) | Cached `NowPlaying` plus `mediaAgeMs` (ms since the phone reported); absent when the device never reported media |
| `signal` | object (optional) | Cached connectivity report (`{"signalStrengths": {...}}`); absent when never reported |

#### `pair`

Initiate pairing with a device, or respond to an incoming pairing request.

**Request payload:**

```json
{"deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_..."}
```

Optional fields:

```json
{"deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_...", "accept": true, "reject": false}
```

- If neither `accept` nor `reject` is set, sends a pair request to the device.
- If `accept: true`, accepts an incoming pair request from the device.
- If `reject: true`, rejects or unpairs.
- If the device has no active connection, the daemon dials it on demand
  using its last-seen discovery address (background auto-dial no longer
  connects to unpaired devices), then sends the pair request.

**Response data:** none (`{"ok": true}`)

#### `pair_listen`

Wait for an incoming pairing request and return the verification key.

**Request payload:** none

**Response data:** `PairListenResult`

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_...",
    "deviceName": "Pixel 9",
    "verificationKey": "ABCD1234EFGH5678"
  }
}
```

The handler blocks until a pair request arrives or the context is cancelled.
The 16-character verification key should be displayed to the user to verify
identity match on both sides.

> The daemon only **reports** the candidate — it does not accept it.
> Accept explicitly with `pair`, reject with `unpair`. This keeps stale
> requests (e.g. leftovers from tests) from pairing silently.

#### `unpair`

Remove a paired device.

**Request payload:**

```json
{"deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_..."}
```

**Response data:** none

#### `ping`

Send a ping packet to a device.

Request battery state from a device.

**Request payload:**

```json
{"deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_..."}
```

**Response data:** `{"charge": 85, "charging": true}` (the daemon waits for the
device to respond and returns the value).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `charge` | number | Battery percentage (0–100) |
| `charging` | bool | Whether the device is currently charging |

#### `connectivity`

Return the last cellular connectivity report cached for a device (same
shape as `connectivity.update` event payloads).

**Request payload:**

```

**Response data:**

```json
{"signalStrengths": {"0": {"networkType": "LTE", "networkDetailedType": "LTE", "signalStrength": 4}}}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

| `networkType` | string | Network generation (`5G`, `LTE`, `GSM`, …) |
| `networkDetailedType` | string | Finer-grained type when reported (may be absent) |
| `signalStrength` | number | Level 0 (no signal) – 4 (full) |

Errors: `device not found`, `connectivity plugin not enabled`,
`no connectivity data (device offline or never reported)`. Reports are
requested fresh on every connect; `kcd watch` also emits a cached
`connectivity.update` on subscribe so clients never boot blind.

#### `clipboard_push`

Push the local clipboard content to a device.

**Request payload:**

```json
{"deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_..."}

## 4. Watch Protocol

The `watch` command establishes a persistent connection that streams live
events as NDJSON. Unlike all other commands, the connection stays open.

### Request

```json
{"cmd": "watch", "payload": {"events": ["battery.update", "notification"]}}
```

The `payload.events` array is optional. If omitted, **all** event types are
streamed. If present, only events whose type string matches one of the entries
are delivered.

### Initial Sequence

1. **Ack line:** The daemon sends one `{"ok": true}` immediately upon
   accepting the watch request. The client must read (and discard) this line
   before processing events.

2. **`state.snapshot`:** One event covering **all known devices** (online
   and offline) with cached battery/media/signal, so clients boot with full
   state from this single connection:
   ```json
   {"type":"state.snapshot","timestamp":"2026-05-27T10:00:00Z","payload":{"devices":[{...DeviceSummary...}]}}
   ```
   Media entries carry `mediaAgeMs` (ms since the phone last reported) with
   no freshness gate — clients apply their own staleness rules. This event
   is sent regardless of `events` filters.

3. **State dump:** For each **connected** device, in arbitrary order:

   **2a. `device.connected`:**
   ```json
   {"type":"device.connected","deviceId":"...","timestamp":"2026-05-27T10:00:00Z","payload":{"id":"...","name":"Pixel 9","type":"phone"}}
   ```

   **2b. `battery.update`:**
   ```json
   {"type":"battery.update","deviceId":"...","timestamp":"...","payload":{"charge":85,"charging":true}}
   ```

   **2c. `mpris.update`** (only if MPRIS plugin is registered AND the cached
       state is less than 10 seconds old):
   ```json
   {"type":"mpris.update","deviceId":"...","timestamp":"...","payload":{...NowPlaying...}}
   ```

   The daemon keeps now-playing state fresh by re-requesting it every 5
   seconds from devices with an **actively-playing** player (see the
   `mpris.update` section below), so this initial dump fires reliably for
   mid-track state — a pure-push client can mount and see the current track
   without polling. Stopped/paused players are deliberately not polled, so
   they age past the 10-second gate and no ghost track is shown after a
   reconnect.

3. **Live stream:** All matching events are streamed as they occur, one per
   line, until the client disconnects or the daemon shuts down.

### Event Wire Format

```json
{
  "type": "battery.update",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:00:00Z",
  "deviceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6_...",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | Event type identifier |
| `timestamp` | string (RFC3339) | UTC time when the event was published |
| `deviceId` | string | The device that triggered the event (empty for daemon-level events) |
| `payload` | JSON | Per-type payload, see section 4.2 |

### Event Filters

The `events` filter is applied on the server side. Only events whose type
string exactly matches one of the filters are delivered. Invalid/unknown
filter strings are silently ignored — they simply match nothing.

### Reconnection

The official `kcd watch` CLI client implements automatic reconnection with
exponential backoff (1 second initial, 30 second maximum, randomized jitter).
Client authors are encouraged to adopt a similar strategy.

**Payload:**

```json
{"devices": [{...DeviceSummary (see `devices`)...}]}
```

### 5.2 Pairing Events

#### `pair.requested`

A remote device is requesting pairing.

**Payload:**

```json
{"name": "Pixel 9", "type": "phone", "verificationKey": "ABCD1234EFGH5678"}
```

The 16-character verification key should be displayed to the user to confirm
the same key is shown on the remote device.

#### `pair.accepted`

A pairing was accepted.

**Payload:**

```json
{"name": "Pixel 9", "type": "phone"}
```

#### `pair.rejected`

A pairing request was rejected, or a device was unpaired.

**Payload:**

```json
{"name": "Pixel 9", "type": "phone"}
```

### 5.3 Battery Events

#### `battery.update`

Battery state changed or was requested.

**Payload:**

```json
{"charge": 85, "charging": true}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `charge` | number | Battery percentage (0–100) |
| `charging` | bool | Whether the device is currently charging |

#### `battery.threshold`

A battery threshold event was received from the device (e.g. low battery
warning).

**Payload:**

```json
{"charge": 15, "charging": false, "event": 1}
```

### 5.4 Notification Events

#### `notification`

A notification was received from a device.

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "appName": "WhatsApp",
  "title": "John Doe",
  "text": "See you at 5",
  "requestReplyId": "reply-123",
  "id": "notif-456"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `appName` | string | Application name (Android `appName` field) |
| `title` | string | Notification title (Android `title` field) |
| `text` | string | Notification body text (Android `ticker` field) |
| `requestReplyId` | string | Present if the notification supports inline replies |
| `id` | string | Notification identifier |

> **Desktop popups:** the daemon shows each phone notification via `notify-send`.
> Popups render **without an icon by default** (`show_icons = false`); set
> `show_icons = true` to display the phone's app icon (downloaded via
> `fetch_icons` and reused across re-posts). Because Android re-posts a
> notification on every update with a stable `id` (e.g. a scrobbler's
> now-playing notification), the daemon replaces the existing desktop popup
> in place (`--replace-id`) so repeated updates collapse to one popup instead
> of flooding the screen — mirroring the reference desktop's
> `Notification::update()`. Disable with `replace_notifications = false`.
>
> When the phone **cancels** a notification (e.g. a scrobbler's now-playing
> popup torn down on pause), the daemon defers closing the desktop popup by
> `cancel_grace_ms` (default `1500`). If the same notification id is re-posted
> within that window (rapid play/pause toggling), the popup is updated in
> place instead of flickering closed and open. A real dismissal — no re-post —
> closes the popup after the grace window. Set `cancel_grace_ms = 0` to close
> immediately on cancel. The `notification.canceled` event is always emitted
> immediately on the cancel packet, regardless of the grace window.

#### `notification.canceled`

A notification was dismissed by the device.

```json
{"id": "notif-456"}

### 5.12 Ring Events

#### `ring.received`

A ring/find-my-phone request was received from a device (the phone is asking
this daemon to ring).

**Payload:** none (`null`)

### 5.13 MPRIS Events

#### `mpris.update`

Now-playing state from a device's media player.

> **Album art:** when the phone advertises a `kdeconnect:/artUri?...` URI,
> the daemon requests the art bytes over a side channel and caches them to
> `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/kcd/art/<kdeArtHash>.<ext>`. While the fetch is in
> flight, events carry `"albumArtUrl": ""` with `"artPending": true` — never
> an unloadable URI, so clients can render a placeholder with no special
> casing. Once fetched, `albumArtUrl` is emitted as a loadable `file://`
> path in a second `mpris.update`. If the fetch fails, the pending flag
> clears on the next state change.

> **Freshness:** the daemon re-requests now-playing from every connected
> device with an **actively-playing** player every 5 seconds
> (`kdeconnect.mpris.request` with `requestNowPlaying: true`). Responses are
> deduplicated — an event is only emitted when the state actually changes.
> This keeps `pos`/state current for pure-push clients (widgets, Waybar)
> that never poll the CLI. Devices that haven't reported a player yet, or
> whose player is stopped/paused, are not polled — a stopped-but-alive
> player keeps its last pushed track (so it can be resumed), but stops being
> refreshed and ages out of the 10-second initial-dump gate.

> **Position:** every event stamps `posAnchorMs` (Unix millis when `pos`
> was sampled). Clients compute live position drift-free as
> `pos + (nowMs - posAnchorMs)` while `isPlaying` (rate 1), frozen
> otherwise — no local timers needed.

> **Session teardown:** when the phone reports a `playerList` that no longer
> contains the device's currently-tracked player (the media session was
> destroyed, e.g. the app was swiped away), the daemon drops the cached
> state and publishes an empty `mpris.update` (`{...NowPlaying...}` with no
> title) so watchers fall back to "no media playing". An empty `playerList`
> (all sessions destroyed) has the same effect. A stopped-but-alive session
> is **not** cleared — only sessions removed from `playerList` are.

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "player": "spotify",
  "title": "Song Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "album": "Album Name",
  "albumArtUrl": "file:///home/user/.cache/kcd/art/1141556203.jpg",
  "url": "spotify:track:...",
  "length": 240000,
  "pos": 45000,
  "posAnchorMs": 1712345678901,
  "isPlaying": true,
  "volume": 80,
  "canControl": true,
  "canGoNext": true,
  "canGoPrevious": true,
  "canPause": true,
  "canPlay": true,
  "canSeek": true,
  "playbackStatus": "Playing",
  "shuffle": false,
  "loopStatus": "None"
}
```

The extension is sniffed from the received bytes (JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP),
defaulting to `.jpg`. The cache directory holds at most 500 files and is
cleared when it overflows.

## 8. Complete Walkthroughs

### 8.1 List Devices (nc)

```bash
$ echo '{"cmd":"devices"}' | nc -U /run/user/1000/kcd/kcd.sock
{"ok":true,"data":[{"id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6_...","name":"Pixel 9","type":"phone","state":"PAIRED","cert_fp":"","last_seen":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","connected":true}]}
```

### 8.2 Watch Events (socat)

```bash
$ socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/run/user/1000/kcd/kcd.sock
{"cmd":"watch","payload":{"events":["battery.update","notification"]}}
```

After sending the request, read the ack line, then process events:

```bash
# With jq for formatting:
$ echo '{"cmd":"watch","payload":{"events":["battery.update"]}}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/run/user/1000/kcd/kcd.sock | while read -r line; do
    [ "$line" = '{"ok":true}' ] && continue
    echo "$line" | jq .
done
```

### 8.3 Pairing Flow

1. **Start listening on the daemon:**
   ```bash
   $ echo '{"cmd":"pair_listen"}' | nc -U /run/user/1000/kcd/kcd.sock
   ```

   This blocks until a pair request arrives. The output:
   ```json
   {"ok":true,"data":{"deviceId":"a1b2...","deviceName":"Pixel 9","verificationKey":"ABCD1234EFGH5678"}}
   ```

2. **In another terminal, accept the pairing:**
   ```bash
   $ echo '{"cmd":"pair","payload":{"deviceId":"a1b2...","accept":true}}' | nc -U /run/user/1000/kcd/kcd.sock
   {"ok":true}
   ```

3. **The phone shows the same verification key.** User confirms on both ends.

### 8.4 Ping a Device

```bash
$ echo '{"cmd":"ping","payload":{"deviceId":"a1b2..."}}' | nc -U /run/user/1000/kcd/kcd.sock
{"ok":true}
```

## 9. Error Handling

### Error Response

All commands return errors in the same format:

```json
{"ok": false, "error": "device not found"}
```

Common error strings:

| Error string | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"device not found"` | The device ID is unknown or not paired |
| `"device not connected"` | The device is paired but not currently connected |
| `"plugin not enabled"` | The required plugin is disabled in config |
| `"invalid payload"` | The request payload could not be deserialized |
| `"command not found"` | The requested IPC command does not exist |

### Connection Loss

- If the daemon is not running, the socket connect will fail with `ENOENT` or
  `ECONNREFUSED`.
- The daemon creates the socket directory and socket file on startup, and
  removes the socket file on shutdown. The state directory (`$XDG_STATE_HOME`)
  is preserved.
- For the `watch` protocol, the daemon does not send explicit keepalive
  pings. A client can detect disconnection by a read returning 0 bytes or an
  error. Implement reconnection with exponential backoff.

### Concurrency

The IPC server is single-threaded per connection; each connection is handled
in its own goroutine. Long-running commands (`pair_listen`, `watch`) block
that connection but do not block other connections. Send one request per
connection and use a separate connection for concurrent commands.
